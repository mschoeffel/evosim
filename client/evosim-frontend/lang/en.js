      heading: 'The scenario',
      introduction:
        'The scenario breaks down into three components and a clear, simple goal.',
      subheading1: 'The map',
      text1:
        'The map consists of many individual tiles. There are two types of tiles: water tiles and grass tiles. Grass tiles have, what could be called, food or energy, which can be consumed by figures and grows back over time. Water tiles do not have energy and kill any figure that touches them.',
      subheading2: 'The figures',
      text2:
        'Figures can be thought of as characters, who move around the map and try to survive as long as possible.',
      text3:
        'In order to achieve that, they have three senses: their current energy, the energy of the tile they are currently standing on, and the energy of the tile ahead.',
      text4:
        'They also can perform three actions: turn, move forwards or backwards, and consume food from the current tile. The energy is then subtracted from the current tile and added to the figure. Over time and with each movement the figure loses energy.',
      text5:
        "Each figure has an artificial neural network that interprets the figure's senses and triggers actions based on them.",
      text6: 'Also figures always belong to a certain population and generation. A population specifies the architecture and learning method of the artificial neural network for each associated figure. The generation indicates how many times this population has evolved.',
      text7:
        'If a figure moves onto a water tile or has no more energy, it dies. If all figures of a generation have died, a new generation of the population is created and the learning process of the population is applied to each figure or to be more precise its neural network.',
      subheading3: 'Ticks',
      text8:
        "The entire application runs through an endless repetition of so-called ticks. With each tick, food is regrown on the map, each figure's senses are evaluated and each figure can perform actions. A small amount of energy is also drained from all figures. Every one million ticks the scenario is reset and the simulation starts over again.",
      subheading4: 'Goal',
      text9:
        'The goal of the scenario is for the figures to survive as long as they can. In order to do that, they need to use the map as intelligently as possible. This includes: taking enough food from the map, passing through grass fields with little energy faster and avoiding water fields.',

      heading: 'What does it show?',
      introduction:
        'Depending on the screen size, the display may vary. For the purpose of the description the usage of a desktop monitor is assumed. On smaller devices the segments are arranged vertically instead of horizontally, as described here.',
      introduction2: 'The application is roughly divided into two parts: the visualization of the scenario and the graphic representation of the data.',
      subheading1: 'Visualization of the scenario',
      image1: 'Image example of the scenario',
      text1:
        'On the left side is the live visual representation of the scenario. Here you can see the map with the grass/water tiles and the figures. The water tiles are shown in blue and the grass tiles, depending on the energy, brown to green. The more energy a grass tile has, the greener it is.',
      image2: 'Gradient from 0 energy to 100 energy',
      text2:
        "The figures are represented as colored dots. Each population has its own color. This way, the population associated with a figure can be recognized directly. In addition, each figure has a direction indicator. This indicates in which direction the figure is looking and from which tile the energy ahead is perceived. The figure's energy is displayed by its opacity: the more opaque the color of a figure, the more energy it has. If a figure has no more energy, i.e. dies, it disappears completely from the map.",

      text5:
        'Statistics about the generations are prepared in the top left in order to be able to trace the historical course of generations. The average lifespan, maximum lifespan and average energy of the last 25 generations of each population can be compared there. This shows, how the different populations change from generation to generation and whether e.g. a population lives longer with each generation.',
      subheading4: 'Representation of the live data',
      image5: 'Image example representation of the live data',
      text6:
        'The live data is processed at the top right and it shows up-to-date information about how many figures are still alive in a population, the current average lifetime/energy and the generation of each population. Here you can see, how the populations are behaving and acting at the current moment of the simulation.',
      subheading5: 'Representation of the artificial neural network',
      image6: 'Image example representation of the artificial neural network',
      text7:
        "If a figure is selected, the artificial neural network of this figure is displayed live in the center. The figure's senses are shown as nodes on the far left (current energy, energy of the current tile and the energy of the tile ahead) and on the far right the possible actions of the figure (turning, moving, eating) can be seen. Depending on the architecture of the network, there are various intermediate nodes and connections between these predefined nodes, which then transfer or manipulate the input information to the right and to the actions. You can click on each node to display the weights of the incoming and outgoing connections. The thicker the connecting line between two nodes, the higher the current weight of this connection is. The current value of each node is displayed inside it. Here can be followed, when a change in the senses/inputs (e.g. a water tile is now in front of the figure) leads directly to a new action in the artificial neural network.",

Also all the code was published via GitHub to make it easily accessible for anyone interested. For example it would be conceivable to add new architectures or learning methods for neural networks and compare them with those already implemented.',
