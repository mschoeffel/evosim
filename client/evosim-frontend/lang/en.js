      introduction:
        'The scenario breaks down into three components and a clear, simple goal:',
      subheading1: 'The map',
      text1:
        'The map consists of individual spaces. There are two types of spaces: water spaces and grass spaces. Grass spaces have food or energy, which can be consumed by characters and grows back over time. Water spaces have no energy.',
      subheading2: 'The characters',
      text2:
        'Characters always belong to a population and generation. A population specifies the architecture and learning method of the artificial neural network for each associated character. The generation indicates how many times this population has evolved.',
      text3:
        'Characters have three senses: the current energy of the character, the energy of the current space of the map they are on, and the energy of the space ahead.',
      text4:
        'Figures can perform three actions: turn, move forward or backward, and consume food from the current space. The energy is then subtracted from the current space and added to the figure. Each action costs the character energy.',
      text5:
        "Each character has an artificial neural network that interprets the character's senses and thus triggers the actions.",
      text6:
        'If a character moves onto a water space or has no more energy, it dies. If all figures of a generation have died, a new generation of the population is created and the learning process of the population is applied to each figure or its neural network.',
      subheading3: 'Ticks',
      text7:
        "The entire application runs in an endless loop. One pass is a so-called tick. With each tick, food is regrown on the map. Each character's senses are evaluated and each character can perform actions. A small amount of energy is also drained from all characters.",
      subheading4: 'Goal',
      text8:
        'The goal of the scenario is for the characters to survive as long as possible. So they need to use the map as intelligently as possible. This includes: taking enough food from the map, passing through grass fields with little food faster and avoiding water fields.',

        'On the left side is the live visual representation of the scenario. Here you can see the map with the grass/water spaces and the characters. The water spaces are shown in blue and the grass spaces, depending on the energy, brown to green. The more energy a grass space has, the greener it is.',
      image2: 'Gradient from 0 energy to 100 energy',
      text2:
        "The characters are represented as colored dots. Each population has its own color. In this way, the population associated with a character can be recognized directly. In addition, each character has a direction indicator. This indicates in which direction the character is looking and from which space the energy ahead is perceived. Depending on the character's energy, the color is also displayed: the stronger the color of a character, the more energy it has. If a character has no more energy, i.e. dies, it disappears completely from the map.",

        "If you have selected a character, the artificial neural network of this figure is displayed live in the center. The character's senses are shown as nodes on the left (current energy, energy of the current space and the energy of the space ahead of the figure) and on the far right you can see the possible actions of the figure (turning, moving, eating). Depending on the architecture of the network, there are various intermediate nodes and connections between these fixed nodes, which then transfer or manipulate the input information to the right and to the actions. You can click on each node to display the weights of the incoming and outgoing connections. The thicker the connecting line between two nodes, the higher the current weight of this connection. The current value of each node is displayed within. Here you can follow live how a change in the senses/inputs, e.g. a water space is now in front of the character, leads directly to a new action in the artificial neural network.",
