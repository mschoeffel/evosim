# evosim
Repository for my bachelor thesis: Visualization of artificial neural networks using a web-based, simplified evolution simulation.


## Docker
Prebuild images ready to start can be found here: [Docker Repository](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/mschoeffel/evosim)

### Docker Compose
To start everything using docker compose simply use the command `docker-compose --env-file ./compose.env up --build --force-recreate --no-deps --remove-orphans -d`.

## Contribution
Contributions will be open after my thesis is finished. Approximately end of May. Until then the code is frozen and no issue or pull request will be done!

Github Discussions is enabled if you got any questions or ideas: [Go](https://github.com/mschoeffel/evosim/discussions)
